          <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Hello and thanks for visting my website!</h1>
          <p style="font-size: xx-large;">By now you must know that I am Colin Hodge. I grew up in Scotia New York with my two younger (twin) brothers and my parents. 
              I graduted from Scotia-Glenville High School in june of 2017, after that began to attend the University of Vermont. Here in Vermont I am currently a senior pursuing a bachelors of
              science in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in math. (This website is currently a work in progress, please excuse the unfinished portions.)
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: xx-large;">My engineering based interests include material science, mechanics, programming, and aerospace technology. I am 
              currently looking for a summer-fall postion for 2021 to give me on the job experience so that I can apply what
              I have learned in the classroom to real world projects. 
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: xx-large;">In my free time I enjoy being outside, the activities I partake in vary from season to season. In the summer months
              I try to fill up most of my time hiking and backpacking. More specifically in the Adirondaks High Peak Region,
              pursuing to climb all of the 46 High Peaks (currently at 39/46), I expect to finish the climbs in the early summer of
              2021. When I'm not hiking in the summer time I am out skating (a skill developed during the pandemic), with my friends
              at the many skateparks in the greater Burlington Vermont area.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: xx-large;"> In the winter skiing starts to take up a majority of my time. Going to school in Vermont has allowed me to ski 30+ days
              each season. Around two-thirds of the days on skis are spent at the resort (lift service), while remaining third is spent
              exploring the backcountry with my friends. Northern Vermont is home to some of the best skiing in the country and I am grateful
              to be exploring it with some of my best friends.
